+ [Here](Cemal-BKManalysis.html) This is my in-class work for week 5. It includes how we derive data from a website and convert into a format such that we can do analysis on it easily. We used BKM as an example. Furthermore, I did some additional analysis on the BKM data I derived which could be some good examples for analysis.
